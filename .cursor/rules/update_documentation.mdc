# Rule: Update Technical Documentation

**Goal:** Ensure the technical documentation accurately reflects the current state of the project after any code changes.

**Instructions:**

1.  **After implementing any code modifications** (e.g., adding features, fixing bugs, refactoring logic, changing dependencies) in the project, **always** update the technical documentation file: [technical_documentation.md](mdc:docs/technical_documentation.md).
2.  **If the file exists:** Modify the relevant sections to describe the changes, update module responsibilities, adjust the execution flow description, or add details about new behaviors or API interactions.
3.  **If the file does not exist:** Create a new `docs/technical_documentation.md` file, providing a comprehensive overview of the project based on its current state (structure, core modules, key logic, API details if applicable, setup, etc.).
4.  Ensure the documentation remains a reliable technical reference for the project.
